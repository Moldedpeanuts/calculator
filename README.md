# calculator
The final project of The Odin Project Foundations section. This project will combine all the foundational javascript we learned while also adding some extra abstractions.

## Process
1. We are starting off with creating just the basic arithmetic functions and testing them in Dev Tools console. The starting basic functions will do addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Of course we should also handle the edge case of division with zero.
2. Each calculator operation consists of three variables: two numbers and one operator button. We need to declare those variables.
3. We will create an operate function that takes three parameters which are our declared variables. Two numbers and one operator. It then will call the arithmetic functions depending on the operator.
